# Logging

WS have logging mechanism for work process, which may do this more effective. In logs/ directory you can find directories for all work modules. In this directories WS create a sub-directories with name how work date. In date-dirs WS create a directories with time of start work. In this directories you can find file run.log with copy of all stdout what you see in cli \(only progress counter ignore here\).

In sub-directory items/ in log directories WS put files with name of objects which requested by modules on server. Content of this files â€” server response. It\`s works with positive responses only, when WS "think" password, directory or other found.
